## Description

This is a coding exercise assigned through the MIT xPro "Professional Certificate in Coding: Full Stack Development with MERN" course. The purpose of this exercise was to use MapBox and data from The City of Boston to show where the bus stops are located between MIT and Harvard using animated location markers.

## Installation

Click the green "Code" button and download the .zip folder containing the repo to your local machine. Once it is downloaded, expand the folder and double click the index.html file to open it up in your default browser. You just have to make sure that all files are downloaded and placed within the same folder in order for the index.html file to work.

## Usage

Simply click the button at the top of the screen saying "Show stops between MIT and Harvard" and a location marker will start moving between the bus stops between the two schools.

## Support

I can be reached via email at micwadeski@gmail.com, or connect with me on LinkedIn at https://www.linkedin.com/in/micwadeski/ for any assistance.

## Roadmap

* Read the documentation of MapBox further and determine ways to further stylize this project.
* Pull the data from the City of Chicago rather than Boston to better relate my current job market.
* Make the map style different.
* Create an input field that will allow the user to track the current location of a certain bus route.
